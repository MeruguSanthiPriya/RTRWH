## Summary

This document contains the 6 core rainwater harvesting categories with detailed cost analysis, each focused on specific structure types and including detailed recommended structures with capacity ranges.

### Category Types:
- **Storage-focused systems** (Categories 1, 6)
- **Recharge-focused systems** (Categories 2, 3, 4, 5)

Each category includes multiple recommended structures to provide comprehensive rainwater harvesting solutions for different building types, locations, and use cases.
